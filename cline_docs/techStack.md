# Technology Stack - Agentic Chat Assistant

## Backend Technologies

### Core Framework
- **FastAPI**: Modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python
  - Automatic API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI
  - Built-in WebSocket support for real-time communication
  - Async/await support for concurrent operations

### Agent and AI Technologies
- **OpenAI API**: For text generation and GPT-based reasoning
- **LangChain**: For building the agentic framework and tool orchestration
- **Pydantic**: For data validation and settings management
- **asyncio**: For handling concurrent tool executions

### Additional Tools and Libraries
- **httpx**: For making HTTP requests to external APIs
- **python-multipart**: For handling file uploads
- **python-jose**: For JWT token handling
- **bcrypt**: For password hashing
- **python-dotenv**: For environment variable management

## Frontend Technologies

### Core Framework
- **React 18**: Modern React with hooks and concurrent features
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better development experience
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server

### UI and Styling
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
- **Lucide React**: Modern icon library
- **React Hot Toast**: For notifications and alerts

### State Management and Communication
- **Socket.IO Client**: For real-time WebSocket communication
- **React Query (TanStack Query)**: For server state management
- **Zustand**: For client-side state management

## Communication Protocol
- **WebSocket**: Real-time bidirectional communication between frontend and backend
- **Socket.IO**: Enhanced WebSocket with fallbacks and room management

## Development Tools
- **Poetry**: Python dependency management
- **ESLint + Prettier**: Code formatting and linting
- **TypeScript**: Static type checking

## Architecture Decisions

### Agentic System Design
- **Tool Registry Pattern**: Centralized registry for all available tools
- **Intent Classification**: LLM-based query analysis to determine appropriate tools
- **Async Tool Execution**: Non-blocking tool execution with streaming responses
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when tools fail

### Communication Flow
1. User sends message via WebSocket
2. Backend classifies intent and selects appropriate tools
3. Tools execute asynchronously with progress updates
4. Results stream back to frontend in real-time
5. Frontend displays results with appropriate formatting

### Security Considerations
- API key management through environment variables
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization
- CORS configuration for frontend-backend communication
