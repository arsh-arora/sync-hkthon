2. ✅ Designed the agent architecture and tool routing system
3. ✅ Set up Python backend structure with FastAPI
4. ✅ Created React frontend structure with TypeScript
5. ✅ Implemented WebSocket communication between frontend and backend

### Phase 2: Core Agent System ✅ COMPLETED
1. ✅ Built query classification system for intent detection
2. ✅ Created tool registry and execution framework
3. ✅ Implemented text generation tool as baseline
4. ✅ Added tool routing logic and response handling

### Phase 3: Frontend Implementation ✅ COMPLETED
1. ✅ Created React components (ChatInterface, MessageBubble, ChatInput, ProgressIndicator)
2. ✅ Implemented WebSocket service for real-time communication
3. ✅ Added state management with Zustand
4. ✅ Created comprehensive TypeScript type definitions
5. ✅ Styled with Tailwind CSS for modern UI

### Phase 4: Integration & Documentation ✅ COMPLETED
1. ✅ Integrated frontend and backend with real-time communication
2. ✅ Added progress indicators and error handling
3. ✅ Implemented conversation history and session management
4. ✅ Created comprehensive README with setup instructions
5. ✅ Added custom hooks and utilities for better code organization

## Project Status: READY FOR DEPLOYMENT

The agentic chat assistant is now complete with:
- ✅ Full backend API with FastAPI and WebSocket support
- ✅ Modern React frontend with TypeScript
- ✅ Real-time communication and progress tracking
- ✅ Agentic system with intent classification and tool routing
- ✅ Extensible architecture for adding new tools
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation and setup instructions

## Next Steps for Enhancement (Future)
1. Add more specialized tools (code execution, web search, image generation)
2. Implement user authentication and session persistence
3. Add conversation export functionality
4. Implement rate limiting and security measures
5. Add unit and integration tests
6. Deploy to production environment

## Current Focus
Project is complete and ready for testing and deployment. All core functionality has been implemented with no mocks or placeholders.
